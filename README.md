# Price Prediction Model — Regression Model Accelerated via Groq

This project builds a fast and efficient price prediction system using a linear regression model powered by Groq's ultra-low-latency inference engine. The goal is simple: make traditional ML regression incredibly fast by offloading computation to Groq's LPU architecture.
